        <p>About: Software Developer breaking into the tech industry. I have always been interested in this field, but wasn't given many opportunities to explore it due to being raised in a small southern town.I have many years of experience in the sales and customer service industry. I hope to help transform the tech world into a more welcoming environment for young women and help people that are interested in lower income areas.</p>
