# Vision
- To create a comic book style web page that presents the user with a series of games and tasks which they must complete in order to exit a horror house succesfully.

# Pain Point
- Our users have already played every video game, watched every movie, and streamed every show. The pandemic has left them bored and restless. Our webpage offers them a simple but enjoyable horror experience.

# Why should anyone care about this product?
- Because you are probably also very bored and looking for something fun, scary, but not too serious. 

# Scope
## The House of Hell will terrorize and horrify while entertaining the user by:
- Confining the user to a dark dilapidated house that would also smell bad if it wasn't just a webpage.
- The user will be guided through the scary house by a creepy butler/maid whom is the only person willing to help the user but still cannot be trusted absolutely.
 - The user will be confronted by several serial killers whom will threaten the user with death and dismemberment if the user fails to win a game or solve a puzzle.
- If the user defeats these killers and their dastardly plans, they will be able to taste fresh air and freedom once again.

## The House of Hell will not:
- The House of Hell will never turn into one of those janky facebook that annoys everyone with notifications
- The House of Hell will never end world hunger because it feeds off the desperation of the poor.

# What is our MVP functionality?
- Three functional games and/or puzzles
- Excellent graphics and design which fully immerse the user in our House of Hell

# What are our stretch goals?
- Each page should resemble a page in a comic book complete with turning effects
- Five functional games/puzzles
- Add in a jump scare
- Sound effects
- Animations
- Making it into Sara's hall of fame (or infamy)
- Getting it done on time

# Data Flow
- The user will wake up in the House of Hell confused where they'll be greeted by the butler/maid whom will introduce them to the page and what is required of them
- The butler/maid will lead the user through different rooms and floors in the house
- on each room/floor, the user will meet a serial killer whom presents them with a task/game that must be completed/won before the user moves on
- If the user fails, the serial killer will remove a limb from the user's 
- Failure occurs if the user loses more than three limbs, the user will have an option to end the game or try again
- Success occurs if the user completes all games/tasks before losing three limbs
- The about me page will appear at the end regardless of success or failure
